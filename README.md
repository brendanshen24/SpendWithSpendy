```bash
pnpm install
npx expo start
```

## Inspiration
In a digital world, kids are losing the tangible connection to money. We wanted to help parents teach financial responsibility through engaging visualizations and a physical object tied to spending.

## What it does
Spending with Spendy is a mobile app that offers engaging and intuitive money visualizations, a robust and secure reloading system, and a tangible physical object (NFC card) tied to spending money online.

## How we built it
We built an iOS React Native app with NFC integration. The app reads a special NFC card to create a physical connection to digital spending.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We competed against 1,154 hackers and 367 projects and won TWO prizes! We're proud of delivering the best design and slide deck, implementing working NFC functionality, and creating a fully functional parental control system - all in 24 hours.

## What we learned
We learned how to implement NFC reading in React Native, create engaging financial visualizations, and build a complete mobile app under extreme time pressure.
